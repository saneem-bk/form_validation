       <u><h4>Angular</h4></u>

      <h5>1. Introduction :</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It's part of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stacks for full-stack development.
       </p>
      <h5>2. TypeScript :</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript adds static typing and other features, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and tooling support.
       </P>
      <h5>3. Architecture :</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where components represent the building blocks of the application. Components encapsulate templates, logic, and styles.
       </p>
      <h5>4. Components and Directives :</h5>
       <p> 
            - Components: Angular applications are composed of components, each with a specific responsibility. Components consist of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and styles.
            - Directives: Angular provides built-in directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngSwitch` for adding dynamic behavior to HTML elements.
       </p>
      <h5>5. Data Binding :</h5>
       <p>
            - Angular supports two-way data binding, allowing seamless synchronization between the model (component) and the view (template). Changes in one automatically reflect in the other.
       </p>
      <h5>6. Dependency Injection :</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular's dependency injection system facilitates the management of application components and their dependencies. This promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability.
       </p>
      <h5>7. services :</h5>
       <p>
            - Angular services are singleton objects used for encapsulating reusable logic and functionality. They can be injected into components to share data and functionality across the application.
       </p>
      <h5>8. RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) :</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular leverages RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and events. Observables, a central part of RxJS, enable the management of streams of data.
       </p>
      <h5>9. Routing :</h5>
       <p>
            - Angular provides a powerful router for building single-page applications with multiple views. It allows developers to define navigation paths, lazy loading, and guards for route protection.
       </p>
      <h5>10.Forms :</h5>
       <p>
            - Angular's form module simplifies the handling of user input and form validation. Reactive Forms and Template-Driven Forms offer two approaches for managing forms in Angular.
       </p>
      <h5>11.Angular CLI :</h5>
       <p>
           - The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) provides tools for creating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. It streamlines the development process.
       </p>
      <h5>12. Testing:</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular encourages test-driven development (TDD) with support for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Tools like Jasmine and Karma are commonly used for testing Angular applications.

      <h5>13. Community and Ecosystem:</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular has a large and active community, contributing to an extensive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources. The Angular documentation is comprehensive, providing guidance for developers.
       </p>
      <h5>.14. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) Support:</h5>
       <p>
           - Angular has features that facilitate the development of Progressive Web Apps, enabling responsive, reliable, and installable web applications.
 
             Angular is a comprehensive framework suitable for building complex and scalable web applications. Its opinionated structure, TypeScript integration, and extensive tooling make it a powerful choice for developers working on large-scale projects.
