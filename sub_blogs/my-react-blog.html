       <u><h4>React</h4></u>
       <h5>1. Introduction:</h5>
        <p>
            - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It is widely used for creating single-page applications where UI components are updated dynamically.
        </p>
       <h5>2. Component-Based Architecture:</h5>
        <p>
            - React follows a component-based architecture. UIs are built using reusable components, each encapsulating its own logic and view. Components can be composed to create complex interfaces
        </p>
       <h5>3. JSX (JavaScript XML):</h5>
        <p>
            - React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows embedding HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easy to write and understand React components.
        </p>
       <h5>4. Virtual DOM:</h5>
        <p>
            - React utilizes a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React updates a lightweight virtual representation of it and calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM.
        </p>
       <h5>5. Unidirectional Data Flow:</h5>
        <p>
            - React enforces a unidirectional data flow, meaning data in an application flows in a single directionâ€”from parent to child components. This simplifies data management and makes the application more predictable.
        </p>
       <h5>6. State and Props:</h5>
        <p>
            - React components can have state and props. State represents mutable data that affects a component's rendering, while props are immutable data passed from parent to child components.
        </p>
       <h5>7. Lifecycle Methods:</h5>
        <p>
            - React components have lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. These methods provide hooks for performing actions at different stages of a component's life.
        </p>
       <h5>8. React Hooks:</h5>
        <p>
            - Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features. Examples include `useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for handling side effects.
        </p>
       <h5>9. React Router:</h5>
        <p>
            - React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It enables the creation of a single-page application with multiple views by mapping URLs to components.
        </p>
       <h5>10. Flux and Redux:</h5>
        <p>
            - React works well with state management libraries like Flux and Redux. These libraries help manage the state of the entire application, making it easier to reason about and maintain.
        </p>
       <h5>11. JSX and Components:</h5>
        <p>
            - JSX allows the mixing of HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, making React components more readable and expressive. Components can be functional or class-based, depending on the need for state and lifecycle methods.
        </p>
       <h5>12. Community and Ecosystem:</h5>
        <p>
            - React has a large and active community. The ecosystem includes a wide range of libraries, tools, and extensions, contributing to the overall development experience.
        </p>
       <h5>13. Create React App:</h5>
        <p>
            - Create React App is a tool that sets up a new React project with a predefined directory structure and build configuration. It simplifies the process of starting a new React application.

              React's simplicity, performance optimization, and component-based structure make it a popular choice for building modern and interactive user interfaces. It is widely used in industry and supported by a robust ecosystem and community.
