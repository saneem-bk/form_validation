       <u><h4>CSS (CASCADING STYLE SHEET)</h4></u>
        <h5>1. Introduction:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS is a styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables the separation of content from presentation, allowing for consistent and visually appealing designs across web pages.
         </P>
        <h5>2. Selectors and Rules:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles. Styles are defined in rules, consisting of a selector and a declaration block with property-value pairs.
         </P>
        <h5>3. Cascading and Specificity:</h5>  
         <p>
             - The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order of precedence when conflicting styles are applied. Specificity determines which rule takes precedence. Inline styles > IDs > classes/attributes > elements.
         </P>
        <h5>4. Box Model:</h5>
         <p>
             - The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered on the page. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and spacing.
         </P>
        <h5>5. Layout:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS provides various layout techniques, including flexbox and grid, for creating responsive and flexible designs. These enable the creation of complex, multi-column layouts without relying on traditional methods.
         </P>
        <h5>6. Responsive Design:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS supports responsive design, allowing layouts to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries are commonly used to apply styles based on characteristics like screen width.
         </P>
        <h5>7. Transitions and Animations:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS transitions and animations enable the smooth transformation of property values over time. This adds interactivity and enhances the user experience.
         </P>
        <h5>8. Colors and Typography:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS provides extensive capabilities for defining colors, including named colors, hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL values. Typography can be customized with font properties, text alignment, and spacing.
         </P>
        <h5>9. Flexibility:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS is flexible and can be applied in various ways, including inline styles, internal styles within the HTML document, and external stylesheets. External stylesheets are commonly used for maintaining consistency across multiple pages.
         </P>
        <h5>10. Browser Compatibility:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS is well-supported across modern web browsers. However, cross-browser compatibility issues may arise, and vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`) are sometimes used for experimental or browser-specific features.
         </P>
        <h5>11. Preprocessors:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less extend the capabilities of CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, and functions. They help streamline stylesheet authoring and maintenance.
         </P>
        <h5>12. CSS Frameworks:</h5>
         <p>
             - CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, provide pre-designed styles and components, speeding up development and ensuring a consistent look and feel across projects.
         </P>
        <h5>13. Transforms and Flexbox:</h5>
         <p>
              - CSS transforms (e.g., `rotate`, `scale`, `translate`) and the Flexbox layout model enhance the ability to create sophisticated and responsive designs.
                CSS is an essential part of web development, playing a crucial role in determining the visual presentation of web pages. It complements HTML and JavaScript, forming a trio that collectively contributes to the creation of dynamic and engaging user interfaces on the web.
